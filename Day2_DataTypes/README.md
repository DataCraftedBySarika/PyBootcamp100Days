## Day 2: Understanding Data Types and Operators in Python

In this project, you will learn about Python’s primitive data types and how to use them in real-world calculations.
## Concepts Covered

### Primitive Data Types
- Strings (`str`)** – Text data
- Integers (`int`)** – Whole numbers
- Floats (`float`)** – Decimal numbers
- Booleans (`bool`)** – `True` or `False`

### Type Checking
- Using `type()` to identify data types

### Flooring a Number
- Using `//` for floor division
- Understanding how Python handles decimal truncation

### Basic Operators
Learn to use Python’s mathematical operators:
- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Floor Division `//`
- Exponentiation `**`

### PEMDAS Order of Operations
Python follows the PEMDAS rule:
1. **P**arentheses  
2. **E**xponents  
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision  
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction  


### Assignment Operators
- `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`

### f-Strings
- Formatting strings using `f""`

## Project: Tip Calculator

You will build a tip calculator that:
1. Takes the total bill amount
2. Asks for the number of people splitting the bill
3. Asks for the tip percentage
4. Calculates how much each person should pay
5. Formats the final result to **2 decimal places**
Example Calculation:
      If the bill was _$150.00_, split between _5_ people, with a _12%_ tip
      (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
      After formatting to two decimal places: 33.60

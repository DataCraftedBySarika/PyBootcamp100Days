# Python Mini Projects

This project contains three beginner-friendly Python projects that use basic programming concepts 
such as `input()`, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

## Task 1: Automatic Pizza Order Program 🍕
**Description:**  
Build a program that calculates the final bill of a pizza order based on the user's choices. 
The program asks for pizza size, pepperoni, and extra cheese, then calculates the total cost.

**Pizza Pricing:**
- Small pizza (S): $15
- Medium pizza (M): $20
- Large pizza (L): $25
- Add pepperoni:
  - Small pizza: +$2
  - Medium or large pizza: +$3
- Add extra cheese (any size): +$1

**Example Interaction:**
Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!
What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: L
Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N: Y
Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: N
Your final bill is: $28.

## Task 2: Rollercoaster Ride Billing 🎢
**Description:**  
Write a program that determines if a person can ride the rollercoaster based on their height and calculates the ticket price based on age. Users can also choose to add a photo.

**Pricing:**
- Child (<12 years): $5
- Youth (12–18 years): $7
- Adult (>18 years): $12
- Add photo: +$3

**Example Interaction:**
Welcome to the rollercoaster!
What is your height in cm? 130
You can ride the rollercoaster!
What is your age? 15
Youth tickets are $7.
Do you want a photo taken? Y or N: Y
Your final bill is $10

## Task 3: Treasure Hunt Game 🗺️
**Description:**  
Create a simple text-based treasure hunt game using Python. The user makes choices to navigate through different paths and tries to find the treasure. The game uses `input()` for decisions and conditionals to determine outcomes.

**Example Interaction:**
Welcome to Treasure Island.
Your mission is to find the treasure.
You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right": left
You come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake.
Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across: wait
You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors: red, yellow, blue
Which color do you choose? yellow
You found the treasure! You Win!

# Day 6 – Python Functions & While Loops

## Topics Covered
- Defining and calling functions
- Code blocks and indentation
- While loops
- Problem-solving with logic
- Automating repetitive tasks

### Functions
Functions help break code into reusable blocks.

def my_function():
    print("Hello World")

## While Loops
Used when you don’t know in advance how many times a loop should run.

while condition:
    do_something()

## Practice Exercises

- Hurdle challenges 
- Maze-solving logic 
- Using functions to avoid repeated code

Most exercises are done in Reeborg’s World, focusing on:
- Moving the robot 
- Detecting walls 
- Turning and looping until a goal is reached 

## What I Learned
1. How functions make code cleaner and reusable 
2. When to use while loops instead of for
3. How to think logically to solve problems
